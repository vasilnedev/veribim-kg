health and safety regulations are themselves
more onerous.
OTHER FORMS OF HOUSE
CONSTRUCTION
This Approved Document includes guidance on
structural elements of residential buildings of
traditional masonry construction. It is recognised,
however, that there are other suitable forms of
construction in use in the housing sector some of
which (e.g. timber framed) have been in common
use for a number of years and have demonstrated
an adequate performance in compliance with the
A1 requirement. Such alternative forms include
prefabricated timber, light steel and precast
concrete framed construction.
A number of guidance documents relating to
these alternative forms are presently being
developed by industry. The intention is to
reference these in this Approved Document
as soon as they become available and are
approved by the Secretary of State.

LOADING AND GROUND MOVEMENT
The Requirements
This Approved Document deals with the following
Requirements which are contained in the Building
Regulations 2010.
Requirement Limits on application
Loading
A1. (1) The building shall be constructed so that the combined dead,
imposed and wind loads are sustained and transmitted by it to the
ground:
(a) safely; and
(b) without causing such deflection or deformation of any
part of the building, or such movement of the ground, as will impair
the stability of any part of another building.
(2) In assessing whether a building complies with sub-paragraph
(1) regard shall be had to the imposed and wind loads to which it is
likely to be subjected in the ordinary course of its use for the purpose
for which it is intended.
Ground movement
A2. The building shall be constructed so that ground movement
caused by:
(a) swelling, shrinkage or freezing of the subsoil; or
(b) land-slip or subsidence (other than subsidence arising
from shrinkage), in so far as the risk can be reasonably foreseen,
will not impair the stability of any part of the building.

small buildings of traditional construction.
c. Section 3 gives guidance on the support
and fixing of wall cladding.
d. Section 4 gives guidance where roofs are
to be re-covered as a material alteration as
defined in the Regulations.
0.2 The safety of a structure depends on the
successful combination of design and completed
construction, particularly:
a. The design should be based on identification
of the hazards to which the structure is likely
to be subjected and assessment of the risks.
The selection of relevant critical situations
for design should be made reflecting the
conditions that can reasonably be foreseen
during future use.
b. Loading. Dead load, imposed load and wind
load should be in accordance with the current
Codes of practice referred to in Section 1 of
this document.
c. Properties of materials.
d. Detailed design and assembly of
the structure.
e. Safety factors.
f. Workmanship.
The numeric values of safety factors, whether
expressed explicitly or implicitly in design
equations, or design values, should be derived
from considerations of the above aspects of
design and construction as a whole. A change in
any one of these aspects may disturb the safety
of the structure.
Loads used in calculations should allow for
possible dynamic, concentrated and peak load
effects that may occur.

Section 2A: Basic requirements for stability
2A1 This section must be used in conjunction
with sections 2B and 2C and its principles relate
to all forms of low-rise residential buildings.
2A2 Adequate provision shall be made to
ensure that the building is stable under the likely
imposed and wind loading conditions. This will
commonly necessitate meeting the following
requirements:
a. That the overall size and proportioning
of the building are limited in accordance
with the specific guidance for each form of
construction.
b. That a suitable layout of walls (both internal
and external) forming a robust 3 dimensional
box structure in plan is constructed with
restriction on the maximum size of cells
measured in accordance with the specific
guidance for each form of construction.
c. That the internal and external walls are
adequately connected either by masonry
bonding or by using mechanical connections.
d. That the intermediate floors and roof are of
such construction and interconnection with
the walls that they provide local support
to the walls and also act as horizontal
diaphragms capable of transferring the wind
forces to buttressing elements of the building.
Note: A traditional cut timber roof (i.e. using
rafters, purlins and ceiling joists) generally has
sufficient built in resistance to instability and wind
forces (e.g. from hipped ends, tiling battens, rigid
sarking or the like). However, the need for
diagonal rafter bracing equivalent to that
recommended in BS EN 1995-1-1:2004 with its
UK National Annex and additional guidance given
in BSI Published Document PD 6693-1:2012 and
BS 8103-3:2009 for trussed rafter roofs should

Notes:
1. This table applies to Group 1 and Group 2 units.
2. For the EN 771 series of standards for masonry units the values of declared compressive strengths (N/mm²) given in Table 6 are mean values.
3. Brick: a masonry unit having work sizes not exceeding 337.5mm in length or 112.5mm in height.
4. Block: a masonry unit exceeding either of the limiting work sizes of a brick and with a minimum height of 190mm. For blocks with smaller heights,
excluding cuts or make up units, the strength requirements are as for brick except for solid external walls where the blocks should have a
compressive strength at least equal to that shown for block for an inner leaf of a cavity wall in the same position.
5. Group 1 masonry units have not more than 25% formed voids (20% for frogged bricks). Group 2 masonry units have formed voids greater than

Minimum depth of strip
foundations
2E4 Except where strip foundations are
founded on rock, the strip foundations should
have a minimum depth of 0.45m to their
underside to avoid the action of frost. This depth,
however, will commonly need to be increased in
areas subject to long periods of frost or in order
to transfer the loading onto satisfactory ground.
In clay soils subject to volume change on drying
(‘shrinkable clays’, with Modified Plasticity
Index greater than or equal to 10%), strip
foundations should be taken to a depth where
anticipated ground movements will not impair
the stability of any part of the building taking due
consideration of the influence of vegetation and
trees on the ground. The depth to the underside
of foundations on clay soils should not be less
than 0.75m on low shrinkage clay soils, 0.9m on
medium shrinkage clay soils and 1.0m on high
shrinkage clay soils, although these depths may
need to be increased in order to transfer the
loading onto satisfactory ground, or where there

Section 4: Roof covering
Materials
4.1 All materials used to cover roofs, excluding
windows of glass in residential buildings with roof
pitches of not less than 15°, shall be capable of
safely withstanding the concentrated imposed
loads upon roofs specified in BS EN 1991-11:2002 with its UK National Annex. Transparent
or translucent covering materials for roofs not
accessible except for normal maintenance and
repair are excluded from the requirement to
carry the concentrated imposed load upon roofs
if they are non-fragile or are otherwise suitably
protected against collapse.
Re-covering of roofs
4.2 The re-covering of roofs is commonly
undertaken to extend the useful life of buildings.
Roof structures may be required to carry
underdrawing or insulation provided at a time
later than their initial construction. This section
provides guidance on determining whether such
work to a roof constitutes a material alteration
under the Building Regulations.
4.3 Where the work involves a significant
change in the applied loading the structural
integrity of the roof structure and the supporting
structure should be checked to ensure that
upon completion of the work the building is not
less compliant with Requirement A1 than the
original building.
4.4 A significant change in roof loading is
when the loading upon the roof is increased by
more than 15%. Consideration might also be
given to whether the roof covering being replaced
is the original as-built covering.
4.5 Where such checking of the existing roof
structure indicates that the construction is unable
to sustain any proposed increase in loading (e.g.
due to overstressed members or unacceptable
deflection leading to ponding), appropriate
strengthening work or replacement of roofing
members should be undertaken. This is classified
as a material alteration.
4.6 In carrying out the checks mentioned in
paragraph 4.3 an increase of stress in a structural
member arising from increased loading does
not necessarily indicate that the roof structure is
less compliant than the original roof provided an
adequate factor of safety is maintained.
4.7 Where work will significantly decrease
the roof dead loading, the roof structure and its
anchorage to the supporting structure should
be checked to ensure that an adequate factor
of safety is maintained against uplift of the roof
under imposed wind loading.

of A3 will be met by an appropriate choice
of measures to reduce the sensitivity of a
building to disproportionate collapse should
an accident occur.
